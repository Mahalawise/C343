The first function I wrote was 0(n^2) because it had for looks and the function contains which is O(n^2). It also matched up with the graph as it curves straight up. Therefore, I believe I can do better.
The second function I made was with an ArrayList because I thought it would be faster due to the instantaneous pull, however the contains function is still O(n^2) therefore the time complexity was still the same as the first function. I then decided to research time complexity functions and found out about hashsets and used a hashmap for my third function because the contain function is O(1) meaning the time complexity is O(n). This is shown in the map as well.
